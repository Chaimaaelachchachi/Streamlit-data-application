# Streamlit-data-application
Building an interactive web application in order to automate the process of Data visualization .
- Analysis of the need and study of the existing .
- Data cleaning and analysis . 
- Facilitate the access to the desired information.
- Context:
-           As part of our end-of-year internship at the National Superior School of Computing and
            Analysis of Systems (ENSIAS) I had done my internship in the Chemical manufacturing com-
            pany OCP , world leader in the phosphate sector.
            The OCP Group is committed to improving the operational efficiency of its activities integra-
            ted value chain, in order to maintain its position as a leader in the phosphat market, through
            including the implementation of new technologies, processes and production methods.
            Projects in this direction include the Slurry Pipeline, which was commissioned in 2014 on
            the integrated chain from Khouribgaâ€™s mine site to the industrial platform of Jorf Lasfar, desi-
            gnated by the North Axis chain.
            The aim of this project is to process and analyse the data of the source and merchentable
            qualities. It also aims to analyse, design and implement an aid system decision-making, with a
            simple and friendly analysis and reporting tool.
